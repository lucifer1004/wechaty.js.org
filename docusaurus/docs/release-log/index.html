<p>​<a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/releases/tag/v0.16.0">v0.16.0</a> release this on 2018-06-20, 290 commits to master since this release</p>

<p>This release is a BETA release which had been improved with lots of huge refactoring since v0.14.</p>

<p>With v0.16, we can use the branding new Puppet System to connect Wechaty API to any kinds of Puppets, for example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mocking - <a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/tree/ed72a78b61ccc352d9bd9f5a06054a218cdd1d0d/src/puppet-mock">PuppetMock</a>​</li>
  <li>Web API via HTTP - <a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/tree/ed72a78b61ccc352d9bd9f5a06054a218cdd1d0d/src/puppet-wechat4u">PuppetWechat4U</a>​</li>
  <li>Web API via Browser - <a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/tree/ed72a78b61ccc352d9bd9f5a06054a218cdd1d0d/src/puppet-puppeteer">PuppetPuppeteer</a> (our classic PuppetWeb)</li>
  <li>Maybe a Official Account Puppet? <a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/issues/1016">#1016</a>​</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using Wechaty in a production environment, It is recormmand to skip this version and wait to the next version of 0.18 because this version is still in <strong>testing stage</strong> and will be continue developing as v0.19.</p>

<p>However, if you want to try the new Puppet like the <a href="https://github.com/lijiarui/wechaty-puppet-padchat">PuppetPadchat</a> which is powered by the Wechat Pad Protocol, you can upgrade to this version and get the following benifits from it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be able to login with the newly registered Wechat Account. (<a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/issues/872">#872</a>)</li>
  <li>Get wechat id for contacts. (<a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/issues/133">#133</a>)</li>
  <li>Get consistent room id for rooms across login session. (<a href="https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/issues/90">#90</a>)</li>
  <li>… To be discovered by you …</li>
</ol>
